> Please read over our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for additional technical guidance if opening a PR.

If you want to contribute features and/or content, you are also free to open a PR. However, you are urged to **start with a PR that is strictly discussion** first so that you don't spend time on work that we end up unable to accept.
